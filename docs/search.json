We are funded by UKRI and The Urban Flows Observatory.\n\n\nWhat is Air Quality?\nAir quality describes the amount of pollutants in the air that we breathe, and it is directly linked to poor health. One pollutant in particular is nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a gaseous pollutant emitted from cars. The Sheffield Childrenâ€™s hospital is an area with heavy traffic flow, and therefore NO2 levels substantially exceed the Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) of the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\n\nWhat are Green Barriers?\nVegetation implemented as part of a cityâ€™s infrastructure is termed a â€˜Green Barrierâ€™. Studies have shown that green barriers can improve air quality by physically and biologically filtering pollutants.\n\n\nOur Project\nWe have implemented green barriers in a garden adjacent to the A57 at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital, and are using low-cost air sensors by AQ Mesh to determine whether they improve the air quality.\n\n\n\nOur barriersðŸ’š\n\n\n\n\nResults\nincomingâ€¦"
