# The Green Barriers Project at the Children's Hospital

This is a project dedicated to improving the air quality at The Sheffield Children's Hospital using green barriers. We are funded by UKRI and The Urban Flows Observatory.

# What is Air Quality?

Air quality describes the amount of pollutants in the air that we breathe, and it is directly linked to poor health. One pollutant in particular is nitrogen dioxide (NO^2^), a gaseous pollutant emitted from cars. The Sheffield Children's hospital is an area with heavy traffic flow, and therefore NO^2^ levels substantially exceed the Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) of the World Health Organisation (WHO).

# What are Green Barriers?

Vegetation implemented as part of a city's infrastructure is termed a 'Green Barrier'. Studies have shown that green barriers can improve air quality by physically and biologically filtering pollutants.

# Our Project

We have implemented green barriers in a garden adjacent to the A57 at the Children's Hospital, and are using low-cost air sensors by AQ Mesh to determine whether they improve the air quality.
